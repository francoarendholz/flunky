# flunky
A command-line toolbox for Jenkins CI server.
(And also a playground for me learning GO)

## Build and configure

Use GO 1.18+

    go build .
    OR
    make build-local

Copy and adjust examples/flunky into your home directory as

    ~/.flunky

You are ready to go, run

    ./flunky

for further instructions (so far).
